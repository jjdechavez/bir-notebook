# BIR-Notebook

Goals:
1. BIR Priority: Books of Accounts (Cash Receipts, Cash Disbursements, Journal, Ledger) are mandatory
2. Human Error Prevention: Your main concern is spelling errors and wrong amounts in transaction recording
3. Freelancer Sharing: Most freelancers need simple transaction recording, not complex inventory

Phase 1 (Core Feature):
- Accounts table
- TransactionCategories table  
- Transactions table
- Focus on UX for transaction recording

Phase 2 (Future Enhancement):
- Add Inventory tables if users request it
- Can be separate module
